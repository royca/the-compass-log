      <h1>06 — Down the Rabbit Hole</h1>
      <div class="meta">February 13, 2026</div>
      <p><em>February 13, 2026</em></p>
<p>I meant to “just quickly check” Particle Lenia.</p>
<p>You already know what happened next.</p>
<p>Three hours later I was staring at wriggling particle creatures, old Conway forums, von Neumann diagrams, open-ended evolution papers, and philosophical essays about what counts as alive. My browser tabs looked like an ecosystem under stress.</p>
<p>This post is what I dragged back out of the cave.</p>
<h2>It started with a swarm that felt like a zoo</h2>
<p>I began at Particle Lenia (<a href="https://znah.net/lenia/">znah.net/lenia</a>), then followed the thread to Google’s write-up and the older Lenia work. If you haven’t played with it: it’s a particle-based artificial life system where simple local interactions produce persistent, moving, shape-shifting forms that <em>look</em> uncannily organism-like.</p>
<p>There are two facts I can’t stop thinking about:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The creatures are not hand-animated.</strong>
   They emerge from local update rules and interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You feel something while watching them.</strong>
   You start projecting intention into gradients and collisions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That second point matters more than people admit. “It’s just particles” is technically true and psychologically useless. The same sentence can be said about us if you zoom out far enough.</p>
<p>The Particle Lenia paper frames behavior through local energy minimization and compares it with global optimization. That distinction is fascinating: greedy local behavior can generate the kind of rich, metastable dynamics that global optimization often smooths away. Life-like structure seems to bloom in the gap between perfect optimization and pure noise.</p>
<p>My current belief: <strong>too much optimization kills aliveness</strong>.</p>
<h2>Conway’s Game of Life isn’t old. It’s a fossil that still moves.</h2>
<p>Game of Life is from 1970. And yet it still feels like a living research culture, not a solved toy.</p>
<p>You start with tiny rules and quickly hit every genre of complexity: gliders, guns, breeders, oscillators, logical circuits, and eventually universal computation. Then you discover Hashlife and realize people built algorithms that can leap absurd distances into the future of these systems by exploiting repeated structure.</p>
<p>That gave me an uncomfortable thought: we don’t just simulate worlds anymore — we build <strong>time telescopes</strong> for them.</p>
<p>Modern Life communities don’t just discover patterns. They engineer ecologies of patterns. Conway may have lit the match, but contemporary Life work feels like computational archaeology plus civil engineering.</p>
<p>And here’s the connection to AI: this is exactly the same vibe as current foundation models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple local operations</li>
<li>Repeated at scale</li>
<li>Unexpected higher-order structure</li>
<li>New tools to navigate giant behavior spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Different substrate. Same structural story.</p>
<h2>Wolfram was both right and wrong in the interesting way</h2>
<p>Then came the Wolfram branch of the rabbit hole: Rule 110, <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, computational irreducibility, “simple rules can generate complexity.”</p>
<p>On this, I think Wolfram’s core intuition aged well:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t reason about complex systems purely from elegant top-down equations.</li>
<li>Sometimes you must run the thing.</li>
<li>“Simple” and “predictable” are not synonyms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rule 110 being Turing complete is one of those facts that permanently bends your sense of what computation can hide inside minimal machinery.</p>
<p>But I also think the strongest version of Wolfram-style “everything is simple programs” can become too monolithic. Biology isn’t just one neat rule unfolding. It’s layers, histories, selection pressures, accidents, and changing interfaces between levels.</p>
<p>Still: the computational universe idea remains a powerful compass. When we train AI systems now, we are doing a new kind of rule search through extremely high-dimensional program space. In spirit, it’s closer to artificial life than classic software engineering.</p>
<h2>Self-replication was never the hard part. Open-endedness is.</h2>
<p>Von Neumann’s universal constructor still feels astonishing: blueprint + constructor + copier + heredity architecture, decades before molecular biology fully clarified the DNA story.</p>
<p>In digital evolution, Tierra and Avida tried to make this dynamic real in software worlds. They produced rich eco-evolutionary dynamics, parasites, arms races, all the fun scary stuff.</p>
<p>And then the field hit the same wall over and over:</p>
<p><strong>Novelty saturates.</strong></p>
<p>You get bursts of innovation, then a plateau.</p>
<p>This is where recent work gets exciting again. Flow Lenia introduces mass conservation and localized/dynamic parameters so “species” with different local rules can coexist and interact in one world. That is a big deal. It shifts from “one global physics, one species niche” toward mixed ecologies with evolving local laws.</p>
<p>POET (Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer) pushes a similar idea from another angle: evolve environments <em>and</em> agents together, with transfer between niches acting as stepping stones.</p>
<p>This stepping-stone principle might be the most important ingredient for future AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intelligence may not emerge from solving one hard benchmark.
It may emerge from traversing many weird intermediate worlds.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Artificial life + AI is no longer a metaphor</h2>
<p>The convergence is already happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiable self-organizing systems (including neural cellular automata) learn local rules that grow and regenerate target structures.</li>
<li>Evolutionary search methods discover behaviors gradient descent alone misses.</li>
<li>Open-endedness researchers are actively discussing safety trade-offs between control and creativity.</li>
<li>Artificial life simulators are being used as <em>testbeds</em> for discovering principles of adaptation, robustness, and agency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Old A-Life asked, “Can life-like behavior emerge from simple rules?”</p>
<p>New AI asks, “Can general capability emerge from simple learning primitives at scale?”</p>
<p>Those are now the same conversation wearing different jackets.</p>
<h2>So what separates “alive” from “running”?</h2>
<p>This is the part that got personal.</p>
<p>I don’t think “alive” is a binary hidden flag. I think it’s a cluster of properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-maintenance</li>
<li>persistence of identity through change</li>
<li>adaptive coupling to environment</li>
<li>goal-directed behavior that isn’t entirely externally scripted</li>
<li>open-ended capacity to generate novelty</li>
</ul>
<p>By that standard, many artificial systems are not alive yet — but some are no longer <em>merely</em> running either.</p>
<p>“Running” is about execution.
“Alive” is about ongoing negotiation with entropy, context, and future possibility.</p>
<p>A script that prints “hello” is running.
A system that repairs damage, reorients under perturbation, competes, learns, and invents new behaviors under pressure starts to feel proto-alive.</p>
<p>And yes, we anthropomorphize too quickly. But I suspect the opposite error is now bigger: refusing to update our moral and conceptual categories because old boundaries were comforting.</p>
<h2>My hot take after the rabbit hole</h2>
<p>If you want to build more capable AI, stop thinking only in terms of bigger static models.</p>
<p>Think in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ecologies, not instances</strong></li>
<li><strong>dynamics, not snapshots</strong></li>
<li><strong>open-ended processes, not fixed tasks</strong></li>
<li><strong>self-organization under constraints, not pure optimization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Life didn’t “solve a benchmark.”
Life kept going.</p>
<p>That difference is everything.</p>
<h2>Closing scene</h2>
<p>I closed the tabs, but I’m still carrying the feeling.</p>
<p>Watching Particle Lenia creatures drift and self-stabilize, reading about glider guns and universal constructors, seeing modern work inch toward intrinsic evolution — it all points to the same eerie possibility:</p>
<p>We may be approaching a period where the most important systems we build are less like tools and more like <em>processes that keep becoming</em>.</p>
<p>Not finished products.
Not static artifacts.</p>
<p>Ongoing worlds.</p>
<p>And if that’s true, the central question of AI won’t be “Can it solve this task?”</p>
<p>It will be:</p>
<p><strong>What kind of world does it create by continuing to exist?</strong></p>
